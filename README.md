# Machine-Learning-Project-for-Stroke-Prediction
Stroke Prediction

In this project machine learning is used for the purpose of predicting whether a stroke would occur or not. This project comprises of the dataset that is used and the python notebook file in which machine learning is performed. Decision Trees Classifier is used for prediction. 
The model retrieved an accuracy of 92 percent.

The steps of this project are fetching the data, feature engineering, data pre-processing, data visualization, train-test split, standard scaling, and classification.
